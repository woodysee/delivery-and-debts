GAME RULES

You play a delivery person delivering lunches.

You start at the top left hand corner of the screen (i.e. the blue square / "moped").

Navigate to the restaurant (i.e. red square / "restaurant") to pick up lunches and deliver the lunches to either one of the three offices (i.e. green rectangles / "deliveryVenues").

Bring the takings back to the restaurant so you can collect your 10% delivery commission which helps to settle your debt.

You lose if you are unable to repay your debt before lunch time ends (i.e. the default duration of 60 seconds).

You lose if you willingly declare bankruptcy by clicking the red x square button on the top left hand corner of the screen.

You win if you are able to repay your debt by the end of lunch time.
